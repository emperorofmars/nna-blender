**Extend any 3d format by abusing node-names to store data!**

This is about as heretical as it sounds, but it works, very well.

**Early in development version, do not use productively!**
**[Download the latest release](https://github.com/emperorofmars/nna_blender/releases/latest)**\
Install it in Blender as a new extension from disk:\
Under `Edit` → `Preferences` → `Get Extensions` find the upper right drop-down menu and press `Install from disk`.
