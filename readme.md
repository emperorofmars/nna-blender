# ⛧ NNA - Node Name Abuse ⛧
#### Blender 4.2+ Tooling
**Extend any 3d format by abusing node-names to store data!**

It works by serializing data into node-names in the scene hierarchy.\
This is about as heretical as it sounds, but it works, very well.

#### Early in development version, do not use productively!
[Download the latest release](https://github.com/emperorofmars/nna_blender/releases/latest)\
Install it in Blender as a new extension from disk:\
Under `Edit` → `Preferences` → `Get Extensions` find the upper right drop-down menu and press `Install from disk`.

⭐ Star this repo if you love heresy! ⭐
